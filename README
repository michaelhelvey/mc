header-only utility library of common data structures in c that i am tired of
re-writing over and over again in every project.

motivation
----------

write c make me less sad

how can i use this in my project?
---------------------------------

please do not.

<small>if you must, copy the header files into your project</small>

building & running the tests
----------------------------

- `make run`

please note that you need libc and *nix things, i do not provide custom
allocators like the cool kids do but maybe eventually i will write an allocator
for this library might be fun idk
